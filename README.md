🎲 **Python Gambling Simulation using Matplotlib**

I recently built a fun project to simulate and visualize a simple gambling game in Python. Here’s what it does:

- 📌 Simulates 30 rounds of betting with a ₹100 wager per round
- 🎯 Each round generates a random “bet” and a random “lucky number”
- 💰 If both match, the player earns ₹900; otherwise, they lose ₹100
- 📉 Tracks and visualizes the player’s account balance using `matplotlib`
- 📈 Helps understand basic probability, randomness, and risk
- 🧠 Reinforces core Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and list management

This was a great exercise in merging logic with data visualization!

🔍 Sample Code Output:  
A line graph showing the rise and fall of account balance over time, reflecting the randomness of the betting outcome.
